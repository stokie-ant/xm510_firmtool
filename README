A firmware packer/unpacker for xm510 ip camera module firmware blob.
As the chance of getting the source code from the manufacturer is slim to none at best.
At least this way we have some control over our hardware.

requirements - bash, zip, unzip, make, gcc, zlib, u-boot-tools (for mkimage)

As root because permissions on firmware filesystem is root...

./firmtool unpack <firmware image bin>
To unpack the firmware.

./firmtool pack <firmware image bin>
To repack all your changes into the firmware bin.

./firmtool tweaks
To apply some tweaks to the unpacked firmware

./firmtool clean
To remove all firmware files and built programs

<firmware image bin> should be in the current directory with this script
It will be overwritten with any changes

The uImages will be extracted to the uImages directory along with Install and InstallDesc wich are the upgrade scripts.
Cramfs images will be extracted to the Images directory,
u-boot.bin and u-boot.env to u-boot. A text file version of u-boot.env is here that you can edit.
Cramfs filesystem images are then extracted to the fs directory, make your changes in here.

<firmware image bin> will be overwritten so make sure to keep a copy of the original just in case something goes wrong.

Tested on Debian 9. Your results may vary

Make sure to always end the env file with a new line or the last line will be ignored
